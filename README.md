# PyCarRide
Used Matplotlib to plot bubble and pie charts using car ride data. Pandas library and Jupyter Notebook was used. 
Three observale trends:
1.There are more drivers in urban areas than suburban areas with least being in rural areas.
2.Most of the total rides were in urban areas, then in suburban and least in rural areas (corresponds to above observation)
3.Total fares collected is most in urban areas, then in suburban areas and least in rural areas.
4. Average fare showed largest swing in rural areas and least in urban areas.
